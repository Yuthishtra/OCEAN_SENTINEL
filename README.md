🌊 Ocean Sentinel

A Smart Coastal Surveillance and Fish Attraction System

🌐 Overview

Ocean Sentinel is an innovative, low-cost, solar-powered system designed to assist coastal fishermen. It combines underwater acoustic technology to attract fish with an intelligent GPS-based border alert system that notifies boat owners when they cross marine boundaries. The system enhances fishing efficiency, promotes sustainability, and improves maritime safety.

⚙️ Key Features

🎣 Fish Attraction Module: Emits low-frequency underwater sounds to attract specific fish species.

🛰️ Border Alert System: GPS-enabled tracking warns when a boat crosses restricted or international borders.

☀️ Solar-Powered Design: Ensures continuous, eco-friendly operation using solar panels and rechargeable batteries.

💧 Waterproof Hardware: Durable and weather-resistant for coastal and marine use.

📡 Optional Dashboard: Real-time monitoring and alerts through a web or mobile interface.

💡 Motivation

Many coastal fishermen face reduced catches, safety risks, and accidental border violations due to lack of modern tools. Ocean Sentinel addresses these issues by merging sustainable fish attraction and intelligent navigation alerts into one compact device—supporting livelihoods and marine conservation.

🧰 Technologies Used

Hardware: Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller, GPS module, acoustic transducer, solar panel, Li-ion battery

Software: Embedded C/C++ for control and GPS logic

Optional Dashboard: Flask or React.js for monitoring and data visualization

Mechanical Design: 3D-printed waterproof housing with marine-grade materials

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Yuthishtra/coastal-eyes-wide.git


Build hardware according to the /hardware and /mechanics documents.

Flash firmware to the microcontroller using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

Calibrate GPS boundaries and test fish-attracting acoustic output.

Mount the device on a boat and monitor alerts or dashboard readings.

🧭 Use Case

Attract target fish species using acoustic pulses.

Get instant GPS alerts if the boat crosses safe fishing zones.

Ensure sustainable and safe fishing operations with solar-powered autonomy.
